# predictNBA
Python project written in Jupyter Notebook to predict the winner of an NBA game using team statistics from the game.
In this project, I predict the outcome of NBA (National Basketball Association) games. The winner of a basketball game is determined by whichever team has the most points when the clock expires. So, I attempt to use statistics other than points to determine the winner of a game in Python using machine learning algorithms. The process of doing so included gathering a substantial amount of data on NBA games, processing the data so that it could accurately be utilized by the chosen Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier models, evaluating the results, then studying and analyzing the output. I have taken previous data on NBA games that have occurred in past seasons. I have used this data to predict whether the home team wins or loses the game. This was shown as a 1 if the home team wins, and a 0 if they lose (meaning the away team won). Statistics used include field goal percentage, free throw percentage, three-point field goal percentage, assists, and rebounds of the home and away teams respectively. These statistics allowed the model to accurately predict the winner of the NBA game. The Logistic Regression model was better at predicting the winner of NBA games than the Decision Tree Classifier model.
